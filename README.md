DroneTech — Login Demo

This repository now contains a simplified frontend demo that only implements a login/logout flow. The page is static and has no backend — it demonstrates a polished login card and a small logged-in view.

How to run
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
2. Enter any username and click Sign in. Use any password — this is a frontend-only demo.

Files
- `index.html` — login and simple logged-in UI
- `style.css` — styling and theme
- `app.js` — lightweight login/logout UI logic
